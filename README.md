Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Remake of the Interpid ship from the Pulsar: Lost Colony game. 
The goal of this project was to investigate how much more immersive the game would look like if it was made with UE instead of Unity.
The ship was constructed very thorougly to look good from inside, but is not supposed to be looked at from outside.
Some simple graph scripting was used to implement illusion of rotation, randomized blinking lights, repair button.
